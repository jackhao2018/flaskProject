[00:15.05]Baby this love, I'll never let it die
[00:21.05]Can't be touched by no one, I'd like to see him try
[00:31.57]I'm a mad man for your touch
[00:34.33]Girl, I've lost control
[00:39.30]I'm gonna make this last forever
[00:41.07]Don't tell me it's impossible
[00:45.80]'Cause I love you for infinity
[00:49.80]I love you for infinity
[00:54.05]'Cause I love you for infinity
[00:58.05]I love you for infinity
[01:18.58]Oh darling, my soul
[01:21.80]You know it aches for your's
[01:24.80]And you've been filling this hole since you were born
[01:34.32]'Cause you're the reason I believe in fate
[01:37.05]You're my paradise
[01:42.30]And I'll do anything to be your love, or be your sacrifice
[01:49.04]'Cause I love you for infinity
[01:53.06]I love you for infinity
[01:56.81]'Cause I love you for infinity

[02:22.80]Meet me at the bottom of the ocean
[02:26.55]Where the time is frozen
[02:31.80]Where all the universe is open
[02:35.08]Love isn't random, we are chosen
[02:39.07]And we could wear the same crown
[02:44.82]Keep slowing your heart down
[02:48.35]We are the gods now
[02:52.30]'Cause I love you for infinity
